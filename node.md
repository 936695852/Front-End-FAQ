<summary>Does Node replace Java or Python?</summary>
  
Node, Java and Python have different strengths.

With Node you get a Robust technology stack, it is fast due to it's event based character, you can use it very good for scaling(Microservices) and it has a rich ecosystem. On the other hand, due to his non-blocking I/O it is not suited for computation-heavy tasks like machine learning.

In Comparison with node, Java is used in big enterprise solutions and it has as well the advantage of multithreading. Python can be better than node, if you want to do some data science or machine learning.

In conclusion it comes all down to the task you want to accomplish.
