<summary>Do I need to learn Express?</summary>
  
Express is the leading Node.js web framework right now. By learning Express you get the advantage of a huge community, great documentation and little trouble finding reusable components or libraries for express itself.

In spite of this, you can also choose another backend framework. Other popular frameworks are for example Hapi.js, Meteor.js or Koa.
