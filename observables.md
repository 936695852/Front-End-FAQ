# Observables

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between the map, switchMap, and mergeMap operators?</summary>

## `map()`

Much like `Array.prototype.map()` this allows you to map an emitted item into something else. 

## `switchMap()`

In contrast to `map` this will allow you to replace the original observable with a new one when ever the source emits a new item.
