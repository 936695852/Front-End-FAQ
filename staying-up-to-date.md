<summary>JavaScript and FrontEnd</summary>

> This is an opiniated list of influencers and other people/companies who are really good at what they are doing. They all relate somehow to FrontEnd and/or JavaScript and most of them constantly share knowledge through blog posts and/or Twitter discussions. Feel free to contribute to this list.

- Dan Abramov([@dan_abramov](http://twitter.com/dan_abramov)) - I don't think that I really need to introduce Dan Abramov, but anyway. He is a main creator of [Redux](https://redux.js.org) and co-author of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), part of team working on ReactJS and just a nice guy ;). He also has stunning courses on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/instructors/dan-abramov). Recently he started a blog - [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/), definitely should add to bookmarks.
- Feross([@feross](https://twitter.com/feross)) - great person whom I started following right after watching his talk about linting, where he introduced [standardJS](https://standardjs.com/), and yeah, he is a creator of that tool. He is also creator of many other cool projects, he is more like tech entrepreneur, but he also has huge experience working on giant companies. By the way, he also has [great blog](https://feross.org/)(I've read much stuff after his talk).
- Ali Spittel([@ASpittel](https://twitter.com/ASpittel)) - Ali is a developer, teacher and a tech blogger and she has newsletters, where she shares some great articles across the web. She is also creator - take a look at [https://learncodefrom.us/](https://learncodefrom.us/)
- Michael Jackson([@mjackson](https://twitter.com/mjackson)) - not that one :). Co-Author of popular `react-router` and owner of [ReactTraining](https://reacttraining.com/). Great guy in tech world, especially he focuses(as I understood) on React. Being co-creator of react-router his guides are really well written. He also provides great trainings and workshops at ReactTraining. Also, he really cares about future of web. Just read this thread.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Web components are a complete waste of time and effort at this point. The champions of web components are too invested to admit it, but there are so many problems with the current spec. They haven&#39;t learned anything from the current state of the art of building UI for the web.</p>&mdash; MICHAEL JACKSON (@mjackson) <a href="https://twitter.com/mjackson/status/1050594839127973896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2018</a></blockquote>


- Kyle Simpson([@getify](https://twitter.com/getify)) - when we talk about JavaScript it is unfair to not include Kyle Simpson, also known as GETIFY. My foundation of JavaScript strengthened after reading his [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) book series. I highly recommend to all new JS devs(not only beginners). You should go to his Twitter account, learn about him, and read the two books mentioned in his profile.
- Todd Motto([@toddmotto](https://twitter.com/toddmotto)) - if I liked Angular and worked with it much, probably Todd Motto would be a number one person whom I should know, and [his blog](https://toddmotto.com/) would be "go-to" resource for(almost) any Angular related question. He writes great stuff on in, also he is Google Developer Expert and creator [Ultimate Angular](https://ultimateangular.com/) course series.
- Chris Coyier([@chriscoyier](https://twitter.com/chriscoyier)) - co-founder of CodePen.io and CSS-tricks. He knows more CSS tricks than anyone else. He is also very active on his blog/website. Definitely should follow.
- Wes Bos([@wesbos](https://twitter.com/wesbos)) - Wes Bos, I call this man a "serial instructor", he has dozens of JavaScript related courses and ton of other useful materials. Just head to his website at [wesbos.com](https://wesbos.com/). By the way, recently he launched [AdvancedReact and GraphQL course](https://advancedreact.com/). This course already has many positive feedbacks. Maybe you should also take a look at it.
- Sarah Drasner([@sarah_edo](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo)) - is an award-winning speaker, Senior Developer Advocate at Microsoft and she writes really good stuff on [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/author/sdrasner/). Also, she is an author of a book about [SVG Animations](https://www.amazon.com/SVG-Animations-Implementations-Responsive-Animation/dp/1491939702). She has a very active Twitter account talking about mostly Engineering, so advicing to follow her. 
- RisingStack([@RisingStack](https://twitter.com/RisingStack)) - this company is really great. I did not investigate much what they are doing, but they are super useful for dev community, since they share really useful articles from real experience. You definitely have to take a look at [their tech blog](https://blog.risingstack.com/) and follow them to stay up to date.
